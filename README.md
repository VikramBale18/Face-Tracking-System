# Face Tracking System

> **Abstract** : This abstract presents a Python-based face tracking system utilizing the dlib and OpenCV libraries. The system detects and tracks faces in real-time by identifying each face, creating a correlation tracker object, and subsequently using the tracker to locate the face in subsequent frames, according to Xailient. This approach enables continuous face localization, even with variations in pose and illumination.
